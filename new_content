<h1> Be-Secure </h1>

<p>Be-Secure is an umbrella of open source security projects, utilities tracker and maintained by the Be-Secure community. </p>

<h3>Vision </h3>

<p>We envision a future where the Be-Secure community becomes the one-stop for all open source security tools and technologies that interoperate without the need for customized integrations with security handled proactively. </p>

<h3>Mission < /h3>

<p> Establish a community of open source security specialist through Be-Secure community initiative </p>

,<h2> Why Be-Secure </h2>

<p>Today open source software is an integral part of the technology landscape in many organizations. Their adoption rate is increasing year on year. The benefits from open source are multi-fold and it is the way forward to develop capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. </p>

<h2> Be-Secure is for </h2>

<p> Organizations, open source developers, security researchers, auditors and regulators – all can benefit from Be-Secure </p>

<h2> TAVOSS </h2>

<p> TAVOSS is Trusted And Verified Open Source Software that has undergone a security assessment by the Be-Secure community. </p>

<h2> Benefits from Be-Secure </h2>

<p> Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by BeSman environments to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.

Developers, auditors, and regulators can create new BeSman Environments and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.

Security assessment environments aid developers and researchers to identify security issues, like unintentional vulnerabilities and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.

Be-Secure Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.

[ Sumod: I feel we may need to replace BeSman environments with Be-Secure security environments in the above benefits section as we have not introduced BeSman yet ]

bes-security-tech-stack-intro.md:

<h1> Be-Secure Open Source Security tech stacks: </h1>

<p> Open source is a vast technology space. We have frequent releases, bug fixes / patches being published very frequently. It is quite a tedious and time consuming effort for an organization to keep track of all changes that happen across the open source software landscape. Hence we have categorised open source technologies into five Be-Secure Open Source security tech stacks or blue prints to help the Be-Secure community navigate through security assessment of open source projects that are part of one of these categories. </p>

<p> The open source projects are categorized based on purpose, interoperability and technology. They also include other open source dependencies that are frequently required to develop enterprise grade open source solutions. </p>

<img : image of the tech stack to be included here />

<p> Each BeSecure tech stack will be associated with two types of BeSman environments namely the Development or Provisioning environment [Dev] as well as the security testing or security sandbox environment [Sec]. </p>

<h4> bes-<name>dev-env </h4>

<p> This is a development environment configured for an open source project, pre-bundled with all the required tools and dependencies that would help the developer to perform their development activities </p>

<h4> bes-<name>sec-env </h4>

<p> This is a security environment configured for an open source project, pre-bundled with all the required tools and dependencies that would help the security team members to perform their security testing activities. </p>

<h1> Be-Secure seven stage security assessment </h1>

<p> This section describes the seven stages of Be-Secure CE security assessment to enhance the security posture of open source projects / open source tech stacks. </p>

<img : link to the seven stage png file />

<p> Once we receive a request from the community member / user of Be-Secure project to assess an open source tech stack, we will fork the respective open source project into Be-Secure namespace. Then we will commence with our seven stage security assessment as listed below - </p>

<ul>

<li> First stage: Identification of the blueprint for BeSman environment using the details on the open source tech stack that has been shared. </li>

<li> Second stage: If a suitable blueprint doesn’t exist, build a new BeSman environment. This will be the base environment to perform development activities for the shared open source tech stack. </li>

<li> Third stage: Build the security testing environment/sandbox that can be utilized for conducting security testing for the specific open source tech stack. </li>

<li> Fourth stage: Conduct security assessment and identify the vulnerabilities in it. This vulnerability information will be published. </li>

<li> Fifth stage: Identify and develop security patches for the identified vulnerabilities. </li>

<li> Sixth stage: Upgrade the respective BeSman environments with the confirmed new security patches to strengthen their security posture. Publish the upgraded BeSman environments for active consumption </li>

<li> Seventh stage: For an existing BeSman environment, the focus is on identifying the latest security vulnerabilities and mapping it to the respective environment. This is a continuous activity that is focused on enhancing the security posture of BeSman environments to address the latest identified vulnerabilities. </li>

<h1> Getting started </h1>

<p> Security for open source projects is of prime importance for us. We have identified different open source security tech stacks – grouping various open source technologies under each of these identified open source security tech stack. Please feel free to check out more about the open source security tech stack by visiting the following section in our website –[link to tech stack md file] </p>

<p> Creation of open source security tech stack is the first stage in our pursuit for open source security. As the next stage we have created the BeSman utility – it is a command-line utility that will enable users to install project environments based on their project needs in a seamless manner without putting much constraint on their available infrastructure. BeSman environments comprise of dev and security testing environments for each identified open source security tech stack. These environments can be customized per project needs and this is the flexibility we would like to share with you. Please refer the following to know more BeSman utility [link to project we contribute md file ] and various environments that can be provisioned [link to tech stack md file ] </p>

<p>In case you are not able to identify a suitable BeSman environment for your project, please visit the following section to understand how to raise a request for a new environment. [link to faq md file for now] </p>

<p > Once you have identified the required BeSman environments, you can access the same from the following GitHub repository. You can use the BeSman environments to set up your development environment or to conduct security testing for your project. The security environments are pre-bundled with open source security tools to help conduct security testing of your projects. You can share your feedback after using the available BeSman environments. This would help us to refine it further. We are happy to help you with the customization on the selected BeSman environments thus enabling you to use these environments with ease. </p>

<p> We also have enabled a Be-Secure Community Dashboard. Please click here to view the dashboard. The dashboard will enable everyone to view the security posture of identified open source projects we track as part of Be-Secure community initiative. We track these projects to keep a tab on their security posture and help the respective contributors to enhance the security posture of their projects. This list will grow as we move forward. Your projects can be one among the many open source projects we track. In case you would like us to track your project, please do visit the section – Onboarding open source projects for tracking. [link to the project we track md file] </p>

Apart from tracking various open source projects, we as a community also contribute to a no of open source projects. To know more about this, please visit the following section –
