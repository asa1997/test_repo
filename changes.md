·         See if you can justify the content in the pages, currently it is all left aligned. The aesthetics of the page can be enhanced by making the content justify aligned. This should be done across all pages.

·         Under What is Be-Secure open source security stack , please include mostly in the following statement – “This aspect is not factored in during selecting an open source technology ”

·         In the same section, reword “ BeSman envs” as “BeSman environments”

·         Please remove the following content from the section “What is Be-Secure open source security stack” – “There are lot many open source tech stacks out there in the world today. An individual will have a wide variety of open source technologies to choose from for their project needs. Each open source technology has its own security stature. Often this may not be factored in while deciding on the tech stack for an open source project. Considerable effort is spent during the development phase to address the security issues. This effort can be reduced if the security of open source technologies / open source project is identified and addressed before it is being consumed.

As the first stage of Be-Secure projects, the focus is currently set on the most popular open source tech stacks. These tech stacks have been grouped into 5 different open source security tech stack                . This approach will help to focus and drive security projects/ utilities more efficiently by addressing the specific security requirements of these tech stacks.”

Include a Mission statement in the landing page. The mission can be “Establish a community of open source security specialist through Be-Secure community initiative”
Move the Vision, Mission and Goal immediately after “What is Be-Secure” section.

In the BeSman page have the following content in the next line “The development environment is pre-bundled with all tools and dependencies that a developer would need to work on a specific open source project. Similarly, the sec environments are pre-bundled with a set of open source security tools that a security tester”.

Ensure consistency across all section headings: either a question mark or :

Please rephrase the following statement under “Why do we need BeSman utility” – “This is a lean effort that should be managed in a better way” as “This is a misspend effort that should be managed in a better way”.
Also add the following statement in the section “Why do we need BeSman utility” – “BeSman utility provides command-line capability to provision customized environments quickly and in a consistent manner”

Change to uppercase for the section heading “Open Source Security Tech stacks”

----------------------------------------------------

For the section “Security for DevOps Tool” please replace the current content with “This security stack focuses on all kinds of open source tools used in DevOps and how they can be secured both in terms of it source code and its implementation. This would enable users to implement DevSecOps using secured DevOps tools. The identified DevOps tools will be assessed for security vulnerabilities and remediated.”
For the section “Language and Framework Security” please replace the current content with “This security stack focuses on all open source programming languages and its associated frameworks that are used to build various applications. These programming languages will be assessed and their vulnerabilities remediated. ”
For the section “Application Security” please replace the current content with “This security stack focuses on all open source applications and how they can be secured.”
For the section “Distributed Application and Blockchain Security” please replace the current content with “This security stack focuses on all open source based distributed applications and blockchain frameworks. Majority of blockchain frameworks are open source in nature.”

For the section “Open Source Security Tool” please replace the current content with “This security stack focuses on all open source security tools and to secure these tools for utilization.”

You can remove the section “At a glance” and its content.
In the Developer page, remove the heading “A quick look in the view of developers”. I suggested this as the content is focused to the topic and it is limited.
Same case with the License page, we need not add additional header on the respective pages. I suggested this as the content is focused to the topic and it is limited.
