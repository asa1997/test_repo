Be-Secure 

Adoption of open source software components in applications have increased over the years, today open source software is part of IT strategy for many organizations. Securing such application is of utmost importance to minimize the impact from security threats and enhance overall security posture of organizations.
Be-Secure is an umbrella of open source security projects and utilities driven as a community initiative by Wipro. These security projects and utilities will be tracked by Wipro’s open source security team and its network of trusted security partners. This is unique proposition leveraging expertise from Wipro and its network of security partners to curate, develop and manage security projects that will help end users to strengthen the security posture of their applications or IT systems or open source projects.
Be-Secure projects will revolve around a set of predefined open source security tech stacks that are curated based on their usage. The different open source security tech stacks are –
•	Security of DevOps Tool stack
•	Language and framework security stack
•	Application security stack
•	Distributed application / blockchain security stack
•	Open source security tool security stack
Our vision for Be-Secure is to be one stop for all users to address their open source security requirements. 
Be-Secure Projects / Utilities:
•	BeSman – is a command-line utility for provision of customized security environments for each open source tech stack. Please refer the following link : https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSman. You can leverage BeSman to build your own security environments that suits your needs.

Growth of open source:
Over a decade ago, open source often resonated with communities and their specific projects. Fast forward today, open source is prominent in the IT landscape. Many organizations have started to realize the benefits of open source and have started to adopt it. Today it is part of enterprise IT strategy and drive enterprise transformational initiatives. Innovation is a necessity for business, open source is equipped to help organizations to be innovative. Today open source is part of almost any industry sector and is showing growing trend of adoption among the industry peers.
Open source is offering lot of benefits for organization, some of them are 
•	Enabling innovation at pace, 
•	Focuses on enhancing developer productivity as developers need not develop everything from grounds up, 
•	The ability for developers to upskill through contribution in various open source community initiatives thus resulting in drawing best talent towards the organization,
•	Enabling organizations to gain visibility among peers in the industry as an open source contributor.

Open source security – factors to be considered
As the open source adoption increases, the footprint of open source technology in the IT landscape increases. A typical open source tech stack based application will consists of internally developed code plus code components sourced from external open source code repositories as well as external binary dependencies consumed during build process. 
All code components may have inherent security vulnerabilities that should be identified and remediated before consuming them. Without formal security policies and controls in place, consuming any open source software component would raise the security risks for the organization. Thus, it is essential to factor in security for open source adoption. 
Key factors to be addressed to secure open source 
•	Absence of security control regime: many organizations don’t have sufficient security policies for consuming open source code components or assessing the changes in open source code components for security. Such lapses in policies, processes and procedures often increases the security threats for organization.
 
•	Lack of clarity of dependencies: There are two types of dependencies – internal and external. Most organization employing version control mechanism can maintain a tab on internal dependencies. This is not the case for external dependencies. The external components are consumed as is without any security assessment, This is a very risky approach impacting threat exposure of applications consuming such external dependencies.
 
•	Unattended inherent vulnerabilities: Many at times, open source code components are consumed due to lack of awareness on the security essentials for open source. The inherent vulnerabilities in these consumed components makes its way into the application and increases its threat exposure. Every code component should be subjected to security assessment. No code component can be deemed secured until it is assessed.
 
•	Limited visibility on open source assets – higher security risks: IT landscape is increasing year on year in every organizations to align with their business requirements. All assets need not be in the same level as many undergo changes at varying pace. Lack of clarity on assets is one of the major reasons for security issues. Open Source software undergo frequent changes. These changes need to be assessed for security issues and confirmed whether it can be consumed. Newer changes at times also address some of the known vulnerabilities thus it is essential to track and assess these changes. This is effort intensive activity and quite often this is overlooked thus impacting the organization’s overall security posture. 

Be-Secure:
Be-Secure is an umbrella of security projects and utilities. These security projects and utilities are for everyone who is focused on securing their open source projects or contribute to open source projects with a focus on security.  Securing open source projects is now a joint responsibility of contributors and consumers of these projects. Be-Secure will enable you to achieve this in a seamless manner.
•	Vision: Enable individuals to secure their open source initiatives by equipping with the required security tools and utilities.
•	Goal: Build an open source security community offering support to enhance security posture of open source initiatives
Open source Security tech stacks:
We have grouped various open source technologies into 5 main categories. By doing so, it will help us to device appropriate security measures and processes to enhance the security of these open source tech stacks. 
We should be able to accommodate almost all the existing open source technologies in any one of the 5 categories. The categories are defined based on the common characteristics and usage of the respective open source technologies.
 




Be-Secure Projects/ Utility:
•	BeSman: a command-line utility to provision customized security environments for an open source security tech stack to address the specific security requirements of the end user.

Today many individuals focus on open source adoption without evaluating the security risks associated with the open source components they consume. This adds on effort on their part to secure their project and is likely to bypassed at times to meet the planned / committed timeline. There are also cases when security is overlooked for functionality gains. This is not only impacting the security posture of the current projects but also impacts the security posture of all other projects that would consume this project components.

Given the rate of open source adoption it is essential that we focus on security of what we consume and what we build as part of open source initiative. BeSman utility will help everyone to address this requirement effectively.

BeSman dev environments will be preconfigured for an open source project along with tools that will enable any developer to commence with their development activity. Similarly, the BeSman sec environment will be preconfigured with open source security tools customized to perform security assessment of an open source project.
