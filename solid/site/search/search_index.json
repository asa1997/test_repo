Organizations have realized the benefits from open source software. This realization has led them to increase their adoption of open source projects to build business capabilities. This approach necessitates the focus on security for open source projects. Be-Secure projects focus on addressing common security requirements of open source projects. They are open for customizations to address specific needs. The benefits of Be-Secure projects are \u2013 - Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by their tools to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues. - Developers, auditors, and regulators can create and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results. - Developers and researchers can identify security issues (including unintentional vulnerabilities and malicious software) and have this information swiftly flow - backward through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue. - Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate. ### Get started with Be-Secure initiative Identifying OSS projects that are being tracked and its latest security posture Please go to the section [OSS projects we track](./tracked_projects.md), this will display details on all open source projects that we track from a security perspective. The BeSecure Community dashboard section will display the security posture of each of these tracked projects. Identifying OSS projects that we contribute Please go to the section [OSS projects we contribute](./Project_contribute.md). It will display details on our contributions to each listed project and open issues that are in progress. You can also participate by picking up any of these open issues and contribute to these issues. To understand more about how you can contribute, please go to the section [How to contribute](./contribute.md). It will provide all information that will help you to become a BeSecure community contributor. Identifying open source security tech stacks and available list of BeSman environments Please go the section OSS projects we track and then refer the [BeSman utility](./Project_contribute.md) section. It will provide all details about the BeSman utility, open source tech stacks and the various BeSman environments that are available for each open source tech stacks. You can use these available BeSman environments for your project needs. You can use these available BeSman environments for your development or security testing requirements. In case you are not able to locate the specific BeSman environment for your needs, please feel free to raise a request to add a new environment. Kindly refer the FAQ section to help you to raise a similar request. VISION We envision a future where the Be-Secure community becomes the one-stop for all open source security tools and technologies that interoperate without the need for customized integrations with security handled proactively. MISSION Establish a community of open source security specialist through Be-Secure community initiative. GOAL Provides tools, services, training, infrastructure, and resources to achieve this vision.","title":"Be secure gettingstr"},{"location":"besec_info/Be-secure_gettingstr.html#why-be-secure","text":"Today open source is the way forward to develop new capabilities through collaboration with open source community projects.

Second stage: If a suitable blueprint doesn\u2019t exist, the community members will work on building a new BeSman environment. This will be the base environment to perform development activities using the shared open source tech stack. Third stage: The next stage will be to build the security testing environment/sandbox that can be utilized for conducting security testing for the specific open source tech stack. Fourth stage: Conduct security assessment based on the open source tech stack and identify the vulnerabilities in it. This vulnerability information will be published. Fifth stage: Identify and develop security patches for the identified vulnerabilities. Sixth stage: Upgrade the respective BeSman environments with the confirmed security patches to strengthen their security posture. Publish the upgraded BeSman environments for active consumption Seventh stage: For an existing BeSman environment, the community will focus on identifying the latest security vulnerabilities and mapping it to the respective environment.
